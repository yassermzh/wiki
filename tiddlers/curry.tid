```
((a,b) -> c) -> (a->b->c)
```
currying is the above function. 
uncurrying is the reverse.

this is built-in in haskell. so you write functions like this: `f a b`

curry in Haskell: `f x y` is same as `(f x) y`.

function application is left associative means:

```
f x = x + 1
g y = y * 2
f g x = (f g) x
```
