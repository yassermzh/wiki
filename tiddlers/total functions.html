Total functions are [[functions|function]] that, for every valid input value, there is a valid, terminating output value. 

```
head: [a] -> a
```
Here, head is not total if it throws when you provide empty array. Generally, when a function throws for some inputs, then it's not anymore total!

To make `head` total, we can embellish the output into `Maybe a` instead of `a`.
