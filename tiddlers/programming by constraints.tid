title: programming by constraints
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The code is list of constraints that a solver tries to find a solution for it. 

* constraints 
* solver
* solution

It maybe called logical programming.

Cassowary is such an approach to solve the UI layout problem. It's a linear programming. Or an optimization problem: to minimize a function based on some constraints.
