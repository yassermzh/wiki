category = object + morphisms

   * morphisms are arrows (-->).
   * there should be arrow from each element to itself, that's identity.
   * composition should work. a-->b, b-->c => there is a-->c

we are talking about category which objects are [[types|type]] and morphisms are [[functions|function]].
