- react/js lessons:
  - <A /> === <A /> // is false
  - <A /> is React.createElement(A) and every timge create new object.
  - react elements are immutable.
  - React.cloneElement( element, [props], [...children] ) is almost equivalent to:  
    <element.type {...element.props} {...props}>{children}</element.type>
  - on functinoal component: if state is same. setting useState won't re-render.
  - on class component, does re-render.
- useEffect
  The one catch is that this runs after react renders your component and ensures that your 
  effect callback does not block browser painting. This differs from the behavior in class 
  components where componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate run synchronously 
  after rendering
- useEffect callback runs async, so itâ€™s not exactly like componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. 
  if you are updating DOM there, you might have flickering effect. then you using useLayoutEffect I guess.
